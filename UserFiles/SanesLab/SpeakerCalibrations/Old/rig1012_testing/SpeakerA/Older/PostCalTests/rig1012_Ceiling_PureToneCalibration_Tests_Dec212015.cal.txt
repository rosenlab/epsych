testing calibration and post-cal test.
using old speaker from 1012 rig. labeled F; probably compromised. 
mic: B&K serial #1733877; type 4136, 1/4".
calibrated with cage and all equipment in room, just poke and spout removed, microphone facing up in center.

desired level 80 dB, actual level 100dB.
before norm parameter of cal macro set to correct value.


rig1012_Ceiling_PureToneCalibration_Test-b_80dB_Dec212015.cal
after norm control added to code.
setting output to 80dB produces 80dB now.
output looks extremely flat.


rig1012_Ceiling_PureToneCalibration_Test-c_80dB_Dec212015.cal
after changing code to read relevant params (norm, freqs) directly from the loaded calibration file.


rig1012_Ceiling_PureToneCalibration_Test-d_80dB_Dec212015.cal
moved microphone to horizontal orientation, facing poke side of cage.
output still very flat, with slightly more variability maybe. 


rig1012_Ceiling_PureToneCalibration_Test-e_80dB_Dec212015.cal
moved microphone to horizontal orientation, facing spout side of cage.
output still very flat, with maybe slightly more variability..? more equipment on this side of the room - empty floor speaker box, eg. 


rig1012_Ceiling_PureToneCalibration_Test-f_80dB_Dec212015.cal
final test, with all equipment in place. mic is positioned as realistically as possible near to poke.
looks as good as any.
