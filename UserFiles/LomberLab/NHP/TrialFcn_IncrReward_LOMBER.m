% 
% Custom trial selection function for increasing reward size for
% consecutive hits on a 2AFC task.  Misses reset the reward size to minimum
% specified amount.
%
% Strategy: Count the number of recent hits and update the reward duration
% parameter tag (in RZ6_Joystick2AFC_TRAINING_Phase2.rcx, this is
% Behavior.Water_Thi) by some increment.  Reset if the last trial was a
% miss or a 'no response'.

%
% Custom trial selection functions can be written to add more complex,
% dynamic programming to the behavior paradigm.  For example, a custom
% trial selection function can be used to create an adaptive threshold
% tracking paradigm to efficiently track audibility of tones across sound
% level or to adjust reward contingencies as the subject improves.
% 
% The goal of any trial selection function is to return an integer pointing
% to a row in the TRIALS.trials matrix which is generated using the
% ep_ExperimentDesign GUI.  Alternatively, the entire TRIALS structure can
% be updated and returned as long as the field "TRIALS.NextTrialID" is
% updated as well.
% 
% The function must have the same call syntax as this default function. 
%       ex:
%           function NextTrialID = MyCustomFunction(TRIALS)
% 
% TRIALS is a structure which has many subfields used during an experiment.
% Below are some important subfields:
% 
% TRIALS.NextTrialID is the next schedule index, that is the row selected 
%             from the TRIALS.trials matrix
% TRIALS.TrialIndex  ... Keeps track of each completed trial
% TRIALS.trials      ... A cell matrix in which each column is a different
%                        parameter and each row is a unique set of
%                        parameters (called a "trial")
% TRIALS.readparams  ... Parameter tag names for reading values from a
%                        running TDT circuit. The position of the parameter
%                        tag name in this array is the same as the position
%                        of its corresponding parameters (column) in
%                        TRRIALS.trials.
% TRIALS.writeparams ... Parameter tag names writing values from a
%                        running TDT circuit. The position of the parameter
%                        tag name in this array is the same as the position
%                        of its corresponding parameters (column) in
%                        TRIALS.trials.

% These values can be updated during the experiment.  Alternatively, you
% could set these values in the ep_ExperimentDesign GUI by preceding the
% name with an astersik (*) which hides it from being updated.  You can
% read that value using:
%  ind = ismember(TRIALS.writeparams,'ModuleAlias.*Parameter_Name');
%  parameterValues = cell2mat(TRIALS.trials(:,ind));

START_REWARDDURATION = 1000; % ms
MIN_REWARDDURATION   = 1500;  % ms
MAX_REWARDDURATION   = 3000; % ms
REWARD_STEPSIZE      = 500;  % ms




% All custom Trial Select Functions need to update this field to select
% which TRIAL.trials row to present next.

% find the least used trials for the next trial index
idx = find(TRIALS.TrialCount == min(TRIALS.TrialCount));

% randomly select the next trial
TRIALS.NextTrialID = idx(randsample(length(idx),1));





% Locate the index of the Water_Thi parameter within the TRIALS.writeparams
% structure.  The TRIALS.writeparams field contains all parameters defined
% in the ep_ExperimentDesign GUI with the parameter functions set to
% 'Write' or 'Read/Write'.  Since the Water_Thi parameter is located on the
% hardware module with the alias 'Behavior', then it is refered to as
% Behavior.Water_Thi.
% tind = ismember(TRIALS.writeparams,'Behavior.Water_Thi');
tind = wParamIdx(TRIALS,'Behavior.Water_Thi'); % use a helper function to do this




% first trial, so there is no performance data to look at yet

    TRIALS.trials(:,tind) = { START_REWARDDURATION };
    return % exit early

% fprintf('Trial Index:  %d\t',TRIALS.TrialIndex)

% subfield name.  Subfield name is: Behavior_Water_Thi
